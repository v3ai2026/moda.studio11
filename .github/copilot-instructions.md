# Copilot Instructions for moda.studio11

## Overview
moda.studio11 is an empty repository. This file establishes guidelines for AI agents to follow as the project grows and code is added.

## Architecture & Components
- **Project Status**: Initial setup phase - no application code yet
- **When code is added**: Document major components, service boundaries, and data flows here
- **Integration Points**: To be determined based on project direction

## Key Workflows

### Local Development
- **Setup**: Follow the procedure outlined in README.md (to be created)
- **Build**: Document build commands once the project structure is established
- **Testing**: Include test runner commands and conventions

### Git Workflow
- Use descriptive branch names: `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `docs/` prefixes
- Commit messages should follow conventional commits: `type(scope): description`
  - Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore

## Code Conventions
- **Language**: To be determined
- **Formatting**: Define linting and formatting rules as project grows
- **File Organization**: Create consistent directory structure for code, tests, and assets
- **Naming Conventions**: Document patterns for functions, classes, variables per language choice

## Important Notes for AI Agents
- This is a greenfield project - establish patterns early for consistency
- All future documentation should be placed in `/.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- Reference specific examples in the codebase (file paths, function names) when describing patterns
- Focus on discoverable patterns, not aspirational practices

## Getting Started
When the first significant code is committed:
1. Update this file with actual architecture details
2. Reference key files that exemplify important patterns
3. Document project-specific conventions that differ from common practices
4. Include specific commands for builds, tests, and debugging
